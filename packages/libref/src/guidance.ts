  "Search for documentation packages available on the registry server. Use short package names like 'react', 'next', or 'fastapi'. If you find a match, call download_package, then retry get_docs. If the registry package is unavailable or insufficient, ask the user to run `libref add` to build docs from source.";

  "If the library is not installed, search the registry with search_packages, download it with download_package, then retry get_docs. If the registry package is unavailable or insufficient, ask the user to run `libref add` to build docs from source.";
